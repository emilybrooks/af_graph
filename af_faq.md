# AF Decompilation FAQ

## What is Animal Forest?
The GameCube title Animal Crossing actually has many different versions released across multiple platforms and regions.

- Apr. 2001 - Doubutsu no Mori (N64)

- Sep. 2004 - Animal Crossing (European release)
- Jun. 2006 - Dongwu Senlin (Chinese iQue port, based off Doubutsu no Mori)

This project focuses on decompiling the original N64 release, Doubutsu no Mori (lit. Animal Forest)

## What about the other versions?
There is a decomp project for Animal Crossing [here](https://github.com/Prakxo/ac-decomp/).

## Why is this a part of ZeldaRET?
Animal Forest is built off the Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask codebase, and the same knowledge gained from decompiling those games applies to Animal Forest as well.

## How can I contribute?
There plenty of ways to get involved, such as decompiling functions, documenting assets, or documenting code.
