# AF Decompilation FAQ

## What is Animal Forest?
It's the N64 version of Animal Crossing. It's original title was Doubutsu no Mori, and was released exclusively in Japan. It was ported to GameCube 8 months later as Doubutsu no Mori +, which was used as the basis for the English localization.

## Why is this a part of ZeldaRET?
Animal Forest is built off the Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask codebase, and the same knowledge gained from decompiling those games applies to Animal Forest as well.

## What about the other versions?
There is a decomp project for Animal Crossing [here](https://github.com/Prakxo/ac-decomp/).

## How can I contribute?
There plenty of ways to get involved, such as decompiling functions, documenting assets, or documenting code.

Project discussion happens in our [Discord](https://discord.zelda64.dev) in the `#af-decomp` channel.
