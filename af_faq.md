# AF Decompilation FAQ

## What exactly is Animal Forest?
In short, it's the N64 version of Animal Crossing, Doubutsu no Mori (lit. Animal Forest).

Animal Crossing has many different versions released across multiple platforms and regions, each with significant changes.

## What about the other versions?
There is a decomp project for Animal Crossing [here](https://github.com/Prakxo/ac-decomp/).

## Why is this a part of ZeldaRET?
Animal Forest is built off the same codebase as Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask. We can use the knowledge gained from those projects when decompiling Animal Forest.

## How can I contribute?
There plenty of ways to get involved, such as decompiling functions, documenting assets, or documenting code.
